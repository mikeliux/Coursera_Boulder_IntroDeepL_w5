# Task
For this week's mini-project, you will participate in one of the Kaggle competitions(Refer the NOTE below for detailed information on the expectations): 

Monet Painting Dataset (New) : 
[https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/gan-getting-started]

Generative Dog Images Dataset (Old) : 
[https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/gan-getting-started/overview]

We will use this Kaggle competition to practice building and training generative deep learning models (mostly GAN). Kaggle introduces an evaluation metric called MiFID (Memorization-informed Fréchet Inception Distance) score to evaluate the quality of generated images. Please have a close look at their explanation here: 
https://www.kaggle.com/c/gan-getting-started/overview/evaluation

The project has 125 total points. The instructions summarize the criteria you will use to guide your submission and review others' submissions. Note: to receive total points for this project, the learner doesn't need to have a top-performing score on the challenge. A mini-project is a weekly assignment, so we don't expect you to iterate over your project until you have a model capable of winning the challenge. The learner needs to show a score that reasonably reflects that they completed the rubric parts of this project, E.g., the score shouldn't be higher than 1000. 

You will submit three deliverables: 

## Deliverable 1

A Jupyter notebook with a description of the problem/data, exploratory data analysis (EDA) procedure, analysis (model building and training), result, and discussion/conclusion. 

Suppose your work becomes so large that it doesn’t fit into one notebook (or you think it will be less readable by having one large notebook). In that case, you can make several notebooks or scripts in a GitHub repository (as deliverable 3) and submit a report-style notebook or pdf instead.

If your project doesn’t fit into Jupyter notebook format (E.g., you built an app that uses ML), write your approach as a report and submit it in a pdf form. 

## Deliverable 2 

A public project GitHub repository with your work (please also include the GitHub repo URL in your notebook/report).

## Deliverable 3

A screenshot of your position on the Kaggle competition leaderboard for your top-performing model.

Note: This assignment has recently been updated to use Kaggle's GAN getting started competition, which is about changing styles of photos to Monet's painting. If you've been working on the older version (Dog image generation) of this assignments, you may not be able to submit results via kaggle and get test scores from Kaggle as the dog image generation competition's submission has been disabled recently. If it's the case, please skip the  deliverable 3. Unless you've spent significant time on the old version (Dog image generation), please use the new version of this assignment:
